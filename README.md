# High Moon: Nebula

**Nebula** is a modular, solar-powered weather sensing mesh designed for hikers, trail networks, and outdoor researchers. Each node can be deployed along a hiking route or in a remote environment to collect live environmental data such as:

- 🌡️ Temperature
- 💧 Humidity
- 🌬️ Wind speed & direction
- 🌤️ Light level / UV index
- 📡 LoRa-based or local wireless communication

Data from nodes can be optionally connected to phones or other devices nearby, or left as part of a long-range mesh for later retrieval.

## 🚀 Goals

- Provide real-time microclimate insights along hiking routes
- Require minimal maintenance (solar, sleep modes, durable casing)
- Be open-source and fully modifiable by others
- Function autonomously or paired with mobile devices

---

## 📦 Hardware (planned/minimum)

- ESP32 / STM32-based microcontroller
- Environmental sensor (e.g., DHT22, BME280, SHT31)
- Anemometer (simple DC motor-based or mechanical)
- Solar panel + battery
- Optional: LoRa module
- Optional: e-paper display
