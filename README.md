# High Moon: Nebula

**Nebula** is a modular, solar-powered weather sensing mesh designed for hikers. Each node can be deployed in almost any environment to collect live environmental data such as:

- 🌡️ Temperature
- 💧 Humidity
- 🌬️ Wind speed & direction
- 🌤️ Light level / UV index
- 📡 LoRa-based or local wireless communication
---

## 🚀 Goals

- Provide real-time microclimate insights along hiking
- Require minimal maintenance (solar, sleep modes, durable casing)
- Be open-source and fully modifiable by others
- Function autonomously

---

## 📦 Hardware (planned/minimum)

- ESP32 / STM32-based microcontroller
- Environmental sensor (e.g., DHT22, BME280, SHT31)
- Anemometer (simple DC motor-based or mechanical)
- Solar panel + battery + wind turbine
- LoRa module

## 🧭 Part of the High Moon Ecosystem

**High Moon** is a collection of open-source tools designed to support exploration and the outdoors.  
Nebula is the weather-awareness layer.
