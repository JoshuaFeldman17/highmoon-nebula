# High Moon: Nebula

**Nebula** is a modular, solar-powered weather sensing mesh designed for hikers and outdoor explorers. Each node can be deployed in nearly any environment to collect real-time environmental data, including:

- Temperature
- Humidity
- Wind speed & direction
- Light level / UV index
- LoRa-based or local wireless communication

---

## Goals

- Deliver accurate microclimate insights along hiking routes and the outdoors   
- Require minimal maintenance (solar power, deep sleep modes, weatherproof casing)  
- Be fully open-source and modifiable by others  
- Operate autonomously without constant user intervention  

---

## Hardware (Planned)

- ESP32 + Arduino Mega based system  
- Environmental sensor (e.g., DHT22, BME280, or SHT31)  
- Anemometer (e.g., DC motor-based or mechanical wind cup)  
- Power supply: Solar panel + battery + wind micro-generator
- LoRa module for low-power, long-range communication

## Part of the High Moon Ecosystem

**High Moon** is a collection of open-source tools designed to empower exploration and self-reliance in the outdoors.  
**Nebula** is the weather-awareness layer of that vision.
